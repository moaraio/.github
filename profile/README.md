# Welcome to Moara.io

**Moara.io** is where researchers unite to spark ideas, discover knowledge, and manage academic literature with ease. We're building the ultimate research platform to help you streamline your academic journey—from sourcing papers to writing reviews and everything in between.

## Our Vision 🚀

We believe that research should be about innovation, not frustration. Our mission is to empower researchers with tools that minimize the overhead and maximize the “aha!” moments. Whether you're diving into academic reviews or simply staying on top of the latest publications, Moara.io is here to help you every step of the way.

## Why "Moara"? 🌱

The name “Moara” stands for Mother of All Research Assistants and comes from the idea of sparking ideas—just like a windmill that sets things in motion, we aim to help your research take flight. Our platform is designed to give researchers the boost they need to focus on what matters most: **the research itself**.

## Let's Collaborate! 🤝

We’re always looking for talented contributors to join us on our mission! Whether you're a seasoned developer, a passionate researcher, or just someone with cool ideas, we’d love to hear from you. Feel free to contact Seth (seth@moara.io).
